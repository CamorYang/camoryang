I'm Jialuo Yang, a PhD student at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Information Science, under Information School, supervised by Professor Christopher Lueg. 

My research interest lies in embodied agent, augmented human HCI to analyze, understand, and design for social interaction. Particularly, I'm currently diving into applying embodied agent as partnership, not on human-agent interaction instead but the human-human communication under human-agent's co-presence. I aim to improve individual's social relationship through such an "perfected" communication that human and agents co-perform tricks such as deception, prompted small talk, strategical self-disclosure.
