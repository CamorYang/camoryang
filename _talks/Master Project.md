Tacit knowledge is essential to mastering woodworking for amateurs. However, to communicate such experiential knowledge to amateurs, they have difficulty finding the knowledge bodily and understand minor difference with experts. In this Master Project, we proposed a way to capture the tacit knowledge through our multi-sensory system that listens to human-material-tool encounter. We then analyzed data to understand what and how much is tacit knowledge in our particular case of craft. We finally designed a situated media to help communicate tacit knowledge in woodworking. As contribution, we explored a flow to capture, understand, and communicate tacit knowledge from experts to the amateurs. This project provides a comparative study to capture and understand tacit knowledge. A tangible interaction design is also verified as good design for exploring tacit learning. We finally raised a design criterion for tacit learning in woodworking.
