Material agency are under discussion that we should listen to non-human's voice. Research applied design to help material speak during human-material interaction. However, people erase material's agency when enacting activity out of materiality, and it raises a concern that we should alter current intra-action to help speak for material. In this project, I designed an actuating machine to enact paper and pen's encounter, and uncover their agency through drawing on the paper escaping from handwriting. This explores a design method to enact new reflective performance of human-material interaction.
